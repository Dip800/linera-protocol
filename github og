#3613   * Remove `--from` requirement for `close-chain` cmd.

Change the CLI to always expect the chain ID without the flag name.

* Cache the command binary path in `ClientWrapper`

Avoid resolving the binary path every time the command needs to be
executed, and prepare to have the path available for a synchronous call
inside a `Drop` implementation.

* Add a `linera wallet show --short` option

Print a simple formatted list of chains in the wallet.

* Refactor to add a `command_arguments` helper

Prepare to be able to get all the common arguments in the synchronous
`Drop` implementation.

* Create an `OnClientDrop` helper enumeration

An option to configure if chains should be closed when the
`ClientWrapper` is dropped.

* Add a `ClientWrapper::close_chain_on_drop` config.

Allow configuring if all chains should be closed when the client
finishes.

* Close chains when `ClientWrapper` is dropped

List all chains in the wallet and close them one by one.

* Drop the clients in separate threads

It's not possible to know which client will have the round to be able to
close the shared chain, so both clients must run in parallel (not in
separate asynchronous tasks, because the `Drop` is blocking) so that the
one that has the round can actually close it and unblock the other
client.
